    /// 1. Register every active leaf as a `GraphTree` node.
    /// 2. Build a deduplicated adjacency list from cursor references
    ///    (self-loops suppressed).
    /// 3. Walk the reference graph with a DFS spanning forest: only the first
    ///    time a node is reached do we emit an `insert_edge` call.  Back-edges
    ///    and cross-edges are silently dropped.
    ///
    /// Producing a spanning forest rather than inserting every edge has two
    /// important benefits:
    ///
    /// - **No cycles in the view tree.**  Mutual references (A→B and B→A) no
    ///   longer create `NodeKind::Cycle` / `NodeKind::Ref` stubs; the user
    ///   just sees A→B without the confusing ↺ marker.
    ///
    /// - **No exponential node growth.**  Previously, inserting hundreds of
    ///   deduplicated edges between the same small set of folder-level leaves
    ///   triggered `deep_copy_subtree` for each duplicate parent, growing the
    ///   tree exponentially.  The DFS guarantees each entity is placed in the
